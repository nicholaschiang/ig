# `ig`

A simple repository that contains the code I used to unfollow every public account that has more than 10,000 followers on Instagram.
I had an issue with following basically everyone on Instagram.
I had grown tired of my feed populated by attractive strangers.
This was also somewhat prompted by a recently discovered disgust for everyone but one person's looks.
